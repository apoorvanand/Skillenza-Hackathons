Consumer should be able to self-register and set-up by providing user info, verify ID using national ID and upload KYC documents.  Also includes capability for the consumer of the loan to perform other basic functions such as accept/reject loan offer, contact support and view loan details like balance and re-payment schedule.  Also include capability for the financial institution to receive KYC info and view a business dashboard of account status.  The app will also obtain and store (on backend) consumer/user mobile phone data, with ability for financial institution to access the data.
